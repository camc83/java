# Senior Developer Test

This is the project that we use to test the knowledge of a Senior Java Backend developer

## Description

The folder contains a partial project using Maven structure with some base code and some unit tests already implemented as well as the first commit on git history.

The main objective is to prove your problem solving as well as code skills.

## Objectives

- The application initially contains 26 tests of which 10 are failing when running ``mvn clean verify``. In order to return the test **at least 5** of those must pass.
- The test are only supposed to show you the intended behaviour of the application, but they do not cover every use case. Feel free to extend them and complete them with additional test case if you think that they can help ensure code quality.
- It is very important that you send us the **complete git history** of your solution. We are really interested on your reasoning and your way of moving forward fixing the test.
- Weâ€™d appreciate if you indicate the different layers of the application, and implement it close to production quality. 


## Notes

Existing code on test classes must not be modified unless it is explicitly allowed by a comment.
 
You have approximately three days to complete the test and send back the result project but feel free to contact your HR link person if you need more time for any reason.
